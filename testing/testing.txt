Beb.Tools - Create Bounding Boxes Script
========================================

Description:
This script applies transforms to all objects
in the scene. Then, it creates a bounding box
(Empty Cube) for each mesh object using its
Texture Space. The mesh is parented to the
Empty, keeping its original transform and
collections.

Usage:
1. Add mesh objects (e.g., cubes) to your scene.
2. Open the N-Panel (press N).
3. Go to the "Beb.Tools" tab.
4. Select this script from the list.
5. Click "Run" to run the script.

What It Does:
- Applies transforms to all scene objects.
- For each mesh object:
  - Creates an Empty Cube at Texture Space center.
  - Sizes it to match Texture Space dimensions.
  - Names it "[MeshName]_BBox".
  - Parents the mesh to the Empty.
  - Keeps the meshâ€™s transform unchanged.
  - Returns mesh and Empty to original collections.
  - Hides Texture Space visibility.

Notes:
- Only works on mesh objects.
- Ignores non-mesh objects (e.g., cameras).
- No selection needed; processes all meshes.
- Texture Space affects box size.
- Adjust Texture Space in mesh properties if needed.

Output:
- See console message:
  "Transforms applied to all objects,"
  "bounding box empties created for meshes,"
  "meshes parented with correct size and returned"
  "to original collections, and texture space"
  "turned off!"
